 * Dilbert has just finished college and decided to go out with friends. Dilbert has some strange habits and thus he decided to celebrate this
 * important moment of his life drinking a lot. He will start drinking beverages with low alcohol content, like beer, and then will move to a
 * beverage that contains more alcohol, like wine, until there are no more available beverages. Once Dilbert starts to drink wine he will not
 * drink beer again, so the alcohol content of the beverages never decreases with the time.
 * 
 * You should help Dilbert by indicating an order in which he can drink the beverages in the way he wishes
 *
 * Input:
 * Each test case starts with 1≤N≤100, the number of available beverages. Then will follow N lines, informing the name of each
 * beverage, a name has less than 51 characters and has no white spaces. Then there is another line with an integer 0≤M≤200 and M
 * lines in the form B1 B2 will follow, indicating that beverage B2 has more alcohol that beverage B1, so Dilbert should drink beverage B1
 * before he starts drinking beverage B2. Be sure that this relation is transitive, so if there is also a relation B2 B3 you should drink B1
 * before you can drink B3. There is a blank line after each test case. In the case there is no relation between two beverages Dilbert should
 * start drinking the one that appears first in the input. The input is terminated by end of file (EOF).
 *
 * Output:
 * For each test case you must print the message: Case #C: Dilbert should drink beverages in this order: B1 B2 . . . BN ., where C is the
 * number of the test case, starting from 1, and B1 B2 . . . BN is a list of the beverages such that the alcohol content of beverage B​i+1 is not
 * less than the alcohol content of beverage B​i−1. After each test case you must print a blank line.
