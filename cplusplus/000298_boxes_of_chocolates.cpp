 * Little Pippy has got a lot of chocolates on her 6-th birthday. She is a very good and charming girl and always shares his belongings with her
 * friends (and she has lots of friends). Now she wants to share all the chocolate with her friends. She will try her best to give all her friend
 * equal number of chocolates but in case she fails, she will give her pet cat Kittu the residue number of chocolates. The chocolates she has
 * got are in boxes wrapped with beautiful papers. Sometimes a box do not contain chocolates but have smaller boxes inside them. Even
 * sometimes the smaller boxes do not contain any chocolates but have further smaller boxes inside them. Only the smallest boxes always
 * contain some chocolates.
 *
 * Input:
 * Input will start with an integer T . Following lines will contain descriptions for T test cases.
 * 
 * First line of each test case will contain two integers N and B indicating the number of friends Pippy has and the number of box of
 * chocolates she has got respectively.
 * Each of the next B lines will contain a description of a single box.
 * These lines will start with an integer K followed by K integers identified as a​1,a​2,a​3,...,a​K. Here a​i indicates the number of
 * boxes the i−th box contains within it where (0<i<K).
 * The last number of the line indicates the number of chocolates contained in each of the smallest box.
 * 
 * All the numbers will be positive and T,B,K will be less than 101 and N, a​i will be less than 10001.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each test case, print an integer on a single line indicating the number of extra chocolates Kittu will get after dividing all of them equally
 * among Pippy ’s friends.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 2
 * 5 2
 * 3 2 3 4
