/**
 * Given a set of points in a two dimensional space, you will have to find the distance between the closest two points.
 *
 * Input:
 * The input file contains several sets of input.
 * 
 * Each set of input starts with an integer N(0≤N≤10000), which denotes the number of points in this set.
 * 
 * The next N line contains the coordinates of N two dimensional points. The first of the two numbers denotes the X-coordinate and the
 * latter denotes the Y-coordinate.
 * 
 * The input is terminated by a set whose N=0. This set should not be processed.
 * 
 * The value of the coordinates will be less than 40000 and non-negative.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each set of input produce a single line of output containing a floating point number (with four digits after the decimal point) which
 * denotes the distance between the closest two points.
 * 
 * If there is no such two points in the input whose distance is less than 10000, print the line ‘INFINITY’.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 3
 * 0 0
 * 10000 10000
 * 20000 20000
 * 5
 * 0 2
 * 6 67
 * 43 71
 * 39 107
 * 189 140
 * 0
 *
 * Output:
 * INFINITY
 * 36.2215
