/**
 * Given an array A. Is there any subset of array A in which if we do AND of all elements of that subset then output should be in power of two
 * (for example: 1,2,4,8,16 and so on).
 *
 * Input:
 * First line contains number of test cases T. Each test first line contains N size of array A and next line contains N space separated integers.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1≤T≤1000
 * 1≤N≤200
 * 0≤A​i≤10^​9
 *
 * Output:
 * For each test case print YES if there is any subset of array A in which if we do AND of all elements of that subset then output should be in
 * power of two else print NO.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 2
 * 3
 * 1 2 3
 * 2
 * 10 20
 *
 * Output:
 * YES
 * NO
