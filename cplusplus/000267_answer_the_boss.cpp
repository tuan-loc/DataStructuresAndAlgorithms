/**
 * Eloy is a hard worker man, however, he is constantly bullied by his superiors, molested by this, one day he was wondering in what “rank”
 * you are, so you can bully the people with lower ranks, also to discover who can really bully Eloy!.
 * 
 * Now, given the number of employees and the number of relations between them, Eloy need you to output the “rank” which employee is in,
 * being 1 the “boss” (not bullied by anybody) and the employee who are in these ranks
 *
 * Input:
 * There will be an integer T denoting the test cases, then, T test cases will follow, each test case starts with two integers N and R, the
 * number of employees and the number of relations between them, the next R lines consists in two integers R1 and R2, meaning that
 * “employee R1 is lower than employee R2's rank”.
 * 
 * Constraints 1 <= N <= 1000; 1 <= R <= 10000
 *
 * Output:
 * You will output for each test case the string “Scenario #i:” where i is the test case you are analyzing, after that, you will print N lines, for
 * each line you will output the rank of the employee and the employee itself, if there is the same rank for several employees, then output
 * them lexicographically ordered (the first is the lower).
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 2
 * 5 6
 * 2 0
 * 2 4
 * 1 4
 * 1 2
 * 3 2
 * 4 0
 * 5 4
 * 1 0
 * 2 0
 * 3 2
 * 4 2
 *
 * Output:
 * Scenario #1:
 * 1 0
 * 2 4
 * 3 2
 * 4 1
 * 4 3
 * Scenario #2:
 * 1 0
 * 2 1
 * 2 2
 * 3 3
