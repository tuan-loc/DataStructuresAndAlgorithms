/**
 * The Hamming distance between two strings of bits (binary integers) is the number of corresponding bit positions that differ. This can be
 * found by using XOR on corresponding bits or equivalently, by adding corresponding bits (base 2) without a carry. For example, in the two
 * bit strings that follow
 * 
 *      A      0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
 *      B      1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
 *   A XOR B = 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
 * 
 * The Hamming distance (H) between these 10-bit strings is 6, the number of 1’s in the XOR string.
 *
 * Input:
 * Input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input contains the number of datasets, and it’s followed by a blank line. Each dataset
 * contains N, the length of the bit strings and H, the Hamming distance, on the same line. There is a blank line between test cases.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each dataset print a list of all possible bit strings of length N that are Hamming distance H from the bit string containing all 0’s
 * (origin). That is, all bit strings of length N with exactly H 1’s printed in ascending lexicographical order.
 * 
 * The number of such bit strings is equal to the combinatorial symbol C(N,H). This is the number of possible combinations of N − H zeros
 * and H ones. It is equal to
 * 
 * (N!)/(​(N−H)!H!)
 * 
 * This number can be very large. The program should work for 1≤H≤N≤16.
 * Print a blank line between datasets.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 1
 * 
 * 4 2
 *
 * Output:
 * 0011
 * 0101
 * 0110
 * 1001
 * 1010
 * 1100
