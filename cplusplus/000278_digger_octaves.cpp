/**
 * After many years spent playing Digger, little Ivan realized he was not taking advantage of the octaves. Oops, sorry! Most of you were not
 * born when Digger came to light!
 * 
 * Digger is a Canadian computer game, originally designed for the IBM personal computer, back in 1983. The aim of the game is to collect
 * precious gold and emeralds buried deep in subterranean levels of and old abandoned mine.
 * 
 * We Digger gurus call a set of eight consecutive emeralds an octave. Notice that, by consecutive we mean that we can collect them one
 * after another. Your Digger Mobile is able to move in the four directions: North, South, West and East.
 * 
 * In a simplified Digger version, consisting only of emeralds and empty spaces, you will have to count how many octaves are present for a
 * given map.
 *
 * Input:
 * Input starts with an integer T, representing the number of test cases (1≤T≤20). Each test case consists of a map, described as follows:
 * An integer N (1≤N≤8), representing the side length of the square-shaped map. N lines follow, N characters each. A 'X' character
 * represents an emerald, and a '.' represents an empty space.
 *
 * Output:
 * For each test case print the number of octaves on a single line.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * 2
 * 3
 * XXX
 * X.X
 * XXX
 * 3
 * XXX
 * XXX
 * XXX

 * Output:
 * 1
